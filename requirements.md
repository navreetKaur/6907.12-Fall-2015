## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Be a web application that was approved by the professor

You may not build whatever you want. Your project must be approved by the professor prior to Oct 8th lecture.
You will automatically fail the class if you build something that's outside the professors approved project.

### 2. Have a service oriented architecture

You project must have a web API layer and a client that consumes it.
Your project must have internal API that hooks in to your core business logic.
You project must have core business logic that's agnostic of the web and the database.

### 3. Not depend on single monolithic web framwork

All of your code should not be in a single monilithic web framework like Spring MVC, Django, or Ruby on Rails.
Doing so will cause you to automatically fail the class.
